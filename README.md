### Description

MSN Buddy Logger is a program that logs when your buddies on your MSN Messenger list sign in and out, change their status, change their name, change their phone #, etc. You can save the log to a text file for future reference or to show to your friends to prove that they *were* online at 2:00 AM. :-D This program is for MSN Messenger 5.x and 6.x, also, this program only works when you are *signed in* to MSN Messenger; if you have DSL (or similar) and are signed in to MSN Messenger all the time like I am, then you will find this program very usefull. It's very interesting to see what you miss when you're not online...
